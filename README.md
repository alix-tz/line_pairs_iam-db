# What is this script?

It helps creating a folder containing the IAM-DB lines in the form of pairs of PNG + TXT. Which is more suitable for training transcription models with HTR engines line Kraken or PyLaia. 

> Note you still need to be granted access to the IAM-DB and to download and unzip the corresponding archives (xml.tgz and lines.tgz) before using the script.
